```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world! This is a very long line which should not be wrapped; instead, the containing box should scroll horizontally.")
}
```

```go
// Package main is the entrypoint for our application.
//
// Lorum ipsum blah blah blah. More information about the package goes here.
package main

import (
    "vita.dev/clique"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
